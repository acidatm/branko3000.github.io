The game was written in gdscript using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine. It is still early in development and currently not a priority. It's an infinite arcade game that is basically reverse tower defense.

Idea and game design are somewhat based on the game [Towerbag](https://matheuscunegato.itch.io/towerbag) by [Matheus Cunegato](https://twitter.com/MatheusCunegato).
