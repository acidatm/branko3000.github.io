I created this website for a virtual exhibition project initially started during the pandemic by Frappant e.V. Our goal was to create a platform for digital-only exhibitions. I approached this by creating a hallway through which visitors can move and enter the different exhibitions.

The enviroment is rendered through a simple mathematical function. While the surroundings are infinite the pillars for the exhibits loop back around, so there is no way to get lost. Visitors can see each other while walking the planes.
