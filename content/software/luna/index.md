Luna is developed as a packaged web app that can be loaded with adb sideload on any device with open bridge. I developed it specifically for my Nokia 8110 4G running a custom ROM. Luna uses [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) by [mourner](https://github.com/mourner/) for it's calculations.

A somewhat working webversion can be found [here](https://luna8110.surge.sh/).

Code can be found on Github: [github.com/branko3000/luna](https://github.com/branko3000/luna).
