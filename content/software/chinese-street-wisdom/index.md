Chinese Street Wisdom is a (underdeveloped) Twitterbot that posts randomly generated "wisdoms" every once in a while. It aims to satirize the spreading of so called wisdom on social media. The bot runs in node.js on a Heroku server (kept alive by free Dyno hours only...). The system to generate the quotes is insanely stupid. But this sometimes leads to quite deep quotes. Here are some highlights:

"Be not afraid on son, be afraid on Uzi."

"A stoked game of chess is like a low key bae: wise."

"It's better to love woke, then to shoot high."
