Lil Wisdoms (formerly known as Chinese Street Wisdom) is a (underdeveloped) Twitterbot that posts randomly generated "wisdoms" every once in a while. It aims to satirize the spreading of so called wisdom on social media. The bot runs in node.js on a Heroku server (kept alive by free Dyno hours only...). The system to generate the quotes is insanely stupid. But this sometimes leads to quite deep quotes. Names are generated based on the Wordnik Random Noun API. Here are some highlights:

'get this: A fly father is like a savage samurai: extra, alright' -Da Unflinchingly Black

Lil Infantilised once said: To lie afraid you must dab shook first, scur

'To stand angry you must shoot lit first' -Lil HYBRIDISING Vert
