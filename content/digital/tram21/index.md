Is it concrete poetry? Is it a drumcomputer?

Tram21 was programmed long before I knew before about sequencers, esolangs and especially [ORCA](https://100r.co/site/orca.html) (which is both btw). It currently uses samples and rather bad js timeout functions. But I plan to use actual soft synthesis and eloquent timing in the future.

Tram interpretes different ASCII signs as specific drums ('~' as a snare for instance). The length of the line the sign was written on determines the notelength. Unknown characters are treated as silence, so is '-'. You can choose presets with uppercase letters, set bpm with numbers and add comments with '#'.

Most interesting parts are layering insane amounts of duplicate lines, playing beat patterns with 'ctrl+x' and 'ctlr+v' and writting "beat poems".
