title: Java/Micro Cesar
type: digital
weight: 7
summary: two educational programs teaching cryptography and Java/JS
---
Both programs teach the basics of object oriented programming language and cryptography using the Cesar's chiffre. I've used both for workshops at [Hackerschools](https://hacker-school.de/).

Microcesar is supposed to be ran on a BBC [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) and can be used to exchange encrypted messages over the radio module.

Code for Microcesar can be found on Github: [github.com/branko3000/microcesar](https://github.com/branko3000/microcesar).

Code for Javacesar can be found on Github: [github.com/branko3000/javacesar](https://github.com/branko3000/javacesar).
