ORCA is an esoteric programming language that was developed for usage as a sequencer for various audio applications. It is an elektron.js app developed by [hundredrabbits](https://100r.co). I primarily use it to sequence my monophonic Mother 32.

I changed various things, adding new operators (like transpose "T"), changing logic and maths to use known operators ("+" for add, "-" for substract and so on) and adding in interactive backgrounds that can be manipulated through the inbuild command line.
