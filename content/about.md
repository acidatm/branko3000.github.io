My name is Johannes and I create interactive spaces.

I used to draw comics and write a blog about the philosophy of aesthetics.

Now I program and make electronic music.

I started freelance work as a webdeveloper in 2017.

In 2018 2 friends and me founded the [ABC*-Festival](https://abcfestival.de). It is a free festival for installed spaces. We had 3 installments in the [Gängeviertel](https://das-gaengeviertel.info/) in 2019 and work together with [Hallo e.V.](https://hallohallohallo.org/de) for 2021 (the 2020 installment didn't happen sadly).

I went to study Human Computer Interaction at the Universität Hamburg in 2018, but dropped out after the first semester. I then started working as a permanently employed software developer in 2019.

In 2018 I took actions to remove all traces of mine on the internet. I deleted all social medias, wrote e-mails to have most information deleted. I started using Linux, encryption, Tor and a password manager. I also dumped my smartphone for a Nokia 8110 4G (which is actually quite modern). It used to run on Kai OS, a bullshit closed source OS, probably collecting data for the big G. Because of that I flashed the phone, installed a custom ROM and started writing my own apps. Since then I have returned to using Instagram for networking purposes (it's really good when making music). Everythin else remained.

[Frappant](https://frappant.org) is an art gallery and off-space of which I am part of since 2019.

In the same year I became a volunteer inspirer at [Hacker Schools](https://hacker-school.de/), an alternative education program.

During the pandemic of 2020 I started playing electric guitar. Which led to pedals. Which led to building pedals. Which led to synthesizers. Which led to building synthesizers. Since then I am playing live improvised techno sets as "Acid At The Mall" and do so on a modular system I partially build and develope the modules for.
