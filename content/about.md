My name is Johannes and I create interactive spaces.

I used to draw comics and write a blog about philosophy of aesthetics.

Now I program and make electronic music.

In 2018 2 friends and me founded the [ABC*-Festival](https://abcfestival.de). It is a free festival for installed spaces. We had 3 installments in the [Gängeviertel](https://das-gaengeviertel.info/) in 2019 and work together with [Hallo e.V.](https://hallohallohallo.org/de) for 2021.

[Frappant](https://frappant.org) is an art gallery and off-space of which I am part of.

I am a volunteer inspirer at [Hacker Schools](https://hacker-school.de/), an alternative education program.

The [XYZ*-Projekt](https://xyzfestival.de) is an event format with access to knowledge and excess to music as it's main goal. It was founded as an outlet of ABC*-Festival in 2019.

I started freelance work as a webdeveloper in 2017.

I went to study Human Computer Interaction at the Universität Hamburg in 2018, but dropped out after the first semester. I started working as a permanently employed software developer in 2019.

I work with free and open source tools only ([GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) suite and [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/)) on a Linux laptop. All websites and web-based projects are static websites, mostly build with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted either with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

I can write HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I have a good understanding of Python and Java.

I know how to work with Laravel, Wordpress, Netlify CMS, Shopify. I have experience working with Git, Shell, Docker, SCSS, jQuery, Node JS and React.
