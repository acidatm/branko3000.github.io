My name is Branko Dreitausend and I create interactive spaces.

In 2018 2 friends and me founded the [ABC*-Festival](https://abcfestival.de). It is a free festival for installed spaces. We had 3 installments in the [GÃ¤ngeviertel](https://das-gaengeviertel.info/) in 2019 and work together with [Hallo e.V.](https://hallohallohallo.org/de) for 2021.

[Frappant](https://frappant.org) is an art gallery and off-space of which I am part of.

I am a volunteer inspirer at [Hacker Schools](https://hacker-school.de/), an alternative education program.

The [XYZ*-Projekt](https://xyzfestival.de) is an event format with access to knowledge and excess to music as it's main goal. It was founded as an outlet of ABC*-Festival in 2019.
