ACID was my first try at creating a standalone desktop software. I really got into feedback based video synthesis and tried replicating that with software.

The first proper version of ACID still used a React based GUI and a canvas based rendering.

In later versions I rewrote the code to be shader based and run in WebGL. I also converted the software to use the same single character programming that I developed for TRAM.

I performed at Sehs√ºchte 2024 with both softwares wrapped into a single package.
