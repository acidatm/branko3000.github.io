When I couldn't come up with a performative text for my next reading at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus I instead wrote a little script that would generate 100 word texts only containing the words "hier" and "da", each text slightly different. I then handed out qr codes and asked the audience to read the text all together without telling them that the texts slightly differed.

The result was that everybody thought they got lost, oriented themselves at their neighbors (which didn't have the same text) and then jumped to a random position in their own text (which matched where they thought everybody else was). Only in the final lines the text only reads "dada" so everybody happily joined together for the finale.
