With music being produced when the 15 second hook does well on Tik Tok and industry plants amassing millions of listeners overnight (well millions of bots) I asked myself: what if we just stop making music for humans all together? This is what my project Music For Bots researches.

For the first ep I took random images from the wikimedia commons and rendered all of the available sizes into ambient tracks. I then uploaded the tracks to soundcloud and started running a small script that would generate plays.

I also created musicvideos by scrolling through the reels of a fresh instagram account in rythm to the tracks.
