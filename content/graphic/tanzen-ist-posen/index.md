I drew this comic after a night out at the Yoko club. We were not only the first to enter but also the last to leave. And we somehow felt responsible for the party.

I later printed this out and asked the Yoko to hang it but they said "It doesnt fit the venue". I learned about the word venue that day. I then took the prints I had already made (on a black and white printer, I didnt use color yet) and just hung them around the city. One even hung at Strips & Stories.

The drawing style of the characters later inspired the Yurei, a group of original characters I created for a graffiti on the gym building at my old school.

Tilman still thinks this is my best work.
