This comic is based upon a night in the the [Yoko](http://www.dieyoko.de/) club in Hamburg.

They later denied to hang this piece by the toilet door. Their reasoning was: "Es passt aktuell nicht in die Venue".

I learned about the word "Venue" that day.

Out of protest I hung this comic in 20 different locations in Hamburg.
